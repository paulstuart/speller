A port of Peter Norvig's spell checker

How could one not be impressed by Peter Norvig's "simple" [spell checker](https://norvig.com/spell-correct.html)?

Being that I've replaced Python with Go as my first choice language, I thought it would be fun to port to Go.

Go is obviously more verbose (~3 times the LOC when factoring out "libraries"), which does speak to the conciseness of Python's list comprehension, but there's so many other virtues that it's still a winner in my mind.
